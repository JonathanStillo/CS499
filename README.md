## Software Design and Engineering Original/Enhancement: Brick Game Enhancement

My Brick Game project was the first artifact I selected for my Software Design and Engineering category. The purpose of this application was to create an engaging, collision-based 2D animation.There are many different kinds of choices or routes we could have went, and I decided to build an original classic game of Brick Breaker. This was not the "Final Project" of this class (CS330 Comp Graphic and Visualization) but was one of our last assignments. 

*Original*

Since this was one of the first courses I took that exposed me to multiple different IDEs and their uses, I knew I had to choose an artifact from this course. Not only that, but just the ability to improve the game in crazy creative ways interested me to want to improve the project. After all, there aren't many times someone has a want to improve or work on a school project. Regardless of why I had chosen the artifact, I had quite a bit to work on and improve. The original project which was what I had turned in for the class was very unpolished. It was a decent project, but nothing was controlled or professional. The balls the player/brick shot were far too numerous and randomly thrown to the poin where the entire game was honestly unplayable. Not only that but the player could literally move off screen and ruin the game. It is just honestly safe to say that the game had much to be improved.

*Enhanced*

As one can see, the project needed work. To begin, I worked on the simple issues. Color scheme to be specific. One huge issue I reviewed in the original project was that the player itself was essentially the same color as the background. Thus I made the background pure black and the player blue. After that I made sure to fix the shooting mechanic to not shoot an insane amount of projectiles and to shoot them in a specific direction. Here are a few extra changed features made to the code and game: Removed a ton of unnecessary commented lines while adding others for simplicity, Redefined the entire code to include far more loops and if statements to remove extremely repetitive coding, Added a feature where the balls can now combine and are shot at an angle from the shooter block, and Updated/Improved the overall syntax and coding structure of the project alongside color scheme. One great improvement I have to mention is the addition of the array/grid in the code that represents the bricks (1 = brick, 0 = empty). This made altering the pattern of the bricks to destroy very simple and convenient compared to my previous project (adding every brick line by line).

Upon reflection of the process of improving and changing my artifact, I discovered how to apply the lessons I had learned while participating in all of my projects at SNHU. I was constantly taught and reminded to really focus on producing clean, efficient programs while adding clear and understandable comments so one does not get lost in the code. It also allows me to demonstrate my ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. I also gained knowledge on how to create a simple game on Visual Studios that was actually enjoyable and playable. Granted, the tools were given to me by my instructor but what I had built using said tools is something I am extremely proud to have participated in. After all, I would have a great bricks game I could play anytime anywhere while knowing that I built it following all coding guidelines and best practices.

## Algorithms and Data Structure Original/Enhancement: Sudoku Solver

*Original* 

This Sudoku Solver project was the second artifact I specifically selected for the Algorithms and Data Structure category. For this category, I was honestly very stumped. I had projects that were suited for it, but no passion to truly make any genuine or outstanding enhancement. With that in mind, I looked elsewhere to procure a suitable project. That is when I landed on enhancing a Sudoku Solver. I had obtained this code through the internet and took days going over the code to genuinely learn what was going on and how it worked. Here is where I had obtained the Original Project to Enhance: https://replit.com/@negoitad_/ICHIGO#main.py

*Enhanced* 

One thing I did note from the original project was the fact that it solved the puzzles without backtracking, and that is where I began my enhancement. I used the same calculations from the util.py file, but made it far more efficient using backtracking (which a lot of articles and videos were present and helpful). Another improvement I saw was the organization of the solved grid. In the original project, the numbers were all over the place and way too spaced out, this sort of spacing and indents were far too much especially for the Visual Studio Code. Thus, I made it more compact and easily distinguishable while adding extra comments to explain and simplify the methods. Although, I felt it was a bit underwhelming to just use backtracking/organization to improve the solver. After all, The main calculations were already made plus it was all extremely easy to do given the language was the same. Given this issue, I also did an extra enhancement which was to convert the enhanced project from python to Java. This was an extremely painful process to go through as the only thing that was transferred was the calculations, everything else from imported packages to the code itself was quite a challenge.

Upon reflection of the process of improving and changing the original Sudoku Solver, I was genuinely proud and felt accomplished with the work I had done. I was constantly taught and reminded how important it was to employ strategies and organize code for collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences, whether coders or audiences, to partake and support decisions made regarding the field of Computer Science. This stood out to me with this project as the person who provided the original project left very little comments which were hard to understand and had to be deciphered. This led me to create strategies/simpler code and organize it to allow collaboration and feedback from those around me regardless of their career or fields of knowledge.

## Database Original/Enhancement: Grazioso Salvare Dog Database

*Original*

For my Third and Final project chosen for the Database Category, I chose the Grazioso Salvare Dog Database project from CS340 Client/Server Development. In this project, I was asked to implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) in order to manage database schemas, change data, and analyze data in order to improve the database of a rescue-animal training company (Grazioso Salvare). In short, Grazioso Salvare is looking for software that can recognize and classify dogs that are up for adoption using the data that animal shelters currently have.

*Enhancement*

While deciding on the Enhancement, I had to keep quite a few things in mind. Firstly, this software was built primarily utilizing CRUD, which gave it quite a few limitations. That is where I would begin my enhancement, expanding the abilities and utilization of CRUD for this database. Secondly, time management. The previous two enhancements and projects took a ton of time and effort to implement, which left me very little for this one. With those two facts in mind, I began my enhancement. As the code essentially speaks for itself, I will give a short description of my enhancement: I started by removing a ton of unnecessary commented lines, while adding some that made the processes and code far more clearer. After that, I added more methods that weren’t included in CRUD but could and will be very useful for the Grazioso Salvare Company to utilize (such as Replace and Count). Finally, I improved upon the current CRUD methods to allow it to CRUD with multiple documents/dogs to allow the company to Insert, Read, Update, and Delete multiple documents/files/data at once.

When I thought back on the process of modifying and enhancing the project, I felt really proud of the work I had done. The significance of demonstrating an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals was something I knew of and was glad to still be able to do. I found this project particularly noteworthy because I had originally messed up this project big time. I believe in this class I had received a C, which isn't necessarily bad but is a fallout from the usual A's and B's I receive in class. CS499 Prompted me to go back, redownload the necessary files and tools to revisit this project and fix it up. Granted refixing it would have been my personal enhancement, but pushing myself further and developing the program to be far more useful with simple yet valued implementations was quite the experience. 

## Professional Self-Assessment

Although somewhat difficult, my experience in the computer science program was well worth it. My lack of prior software engineering experience something I couldn't ignore, but worked right through. It honestly forced me to come up with solutions and think creatively, which is a lifetime skill I appreciate to the core. To think this all began because I decided to work at a Walmart store and got given the opportunity to attend Southern New Hampshire University's Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree with little to no out of pocket cost. One could wonder why I had chosen this specific change, and well I have no good answer besides opportunity. I had worked overnights, mornings, and swing shifts at customer service, retail, warehouse, and fast food. None of it really entailed any passion or made me want to stay, but one thing I am passionate about has to be technology. 

I had to use my preferred language, Java/C++, to highlight my abilities, and although I acknowledge that I still have work to do, I am eager to put in the effort. Upon starting my studies at SNHU, I initially learned Python, which appeared to be simple. However, when I encountered Java, I was completely unprepared as I was still getting used to Python. Then along came C++, which was like a breath of fresh air because it was similar to Java with a few minor changes here and there. I knew immediately that I was at ease with Java and C++ programming. Finding out that the majority of my final classes were written in C++ was very destressing, and I even managed to refresh myself on Java with one of my classes' final projects. 

As a student at SNHU, I didn't usually work by myself.  I worked in a group setting and could always rely on my instructor for support and guidance. We had to work as a team to create a variety of projects, which made programming seem unreal. I was working on a project with a large number of people, which inspired me to want to collaborate with them more in order to finish the team project. Through our discussions on project-related issues in the courses, this collaboration developed and persisted. I was excited to get started in the field since it was so much fun.

One note I would like to leave this self-assessment with is that I didn't personally know anyone who knew computer science, therefore I didn't know who I could go or who to guide me (beside the instructor) in learning to solve any particular problem or application. This led to many moments when I felt like giving up from the frustration of not understanding code or misunderstanding asignments. In fact, this very class (CS499) had me extremely frustrated as I had no projects to enhance and essentially started 3 steps backwards. But since I've never been one to give up, I kept going dedicated and determined to succeed! In this journey, I completed each course assignment one at a time, and even though I'm getting close to the finish line, there's still a lot I need to learn and practice every day to be consistent and sharp. After all, I am here managing 3 classes per semester, thus I know I can handle the work! All there is left to do is apply myself and become an official Software Engineer.
