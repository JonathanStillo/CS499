6. Professional Self-Assessment

## Code Review
This code review is meant to Address the Following:

[x] Existing functionality: Walk through and identify what the code is, what it does, and how it works.

[x] Code Analysis: Review the code structure, look for code efficiencies, and check for comments and code documentation. Explain your findings.

[x] Look for enhancement: Walk through and explain planned enhancements.

## Software Design and Engineering Original: Brick Game Enhancement

My Brick Game project was the first artifact I selected for my Software Design and Engineering category. The purpose of this application was to create an engaging, collision-based 2D animation.There are many different kinds of choices or routes we could have went, and I decided to build an original classic game of Brick Breaker. This was not the "Final Project" of this class (CS330 Comp Graphic and Visualization) but was one of our last assignments. 

Since this was one of the first courses I took that exposed me to multiple different IDEs and their uses, I knew I had to choose an artifact from this course. Not only that
